    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/"> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> is an international community where member organizations and the public work together to develop standards for the World Wide Web. It is currently led by Tim Berners Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe. As an organization W3C aims to bring out the full potential of the WWW by developing a set of protocols and guidelines. The organization espouses the principles of Open Standards to ensure fair and balanced decision making and contributions to the mission.</p>

      <p>One of the important standards that was developed by W3C was for the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). It is the language used by web browsers across the World and the Internet to display pages and documents. When a browser makes a request for a webpage by going to a URL, the web server sends the HTML document over TCP/IP using HTTP(S) protocol. The HTML describes the contents of the document semantically and instructs the browser to display it. Generally, there are other components included in the HTML document, such as javascript or vbscript that allow code to be execute on the client or serve side, <a href="">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> that defines the look and layout of the content.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">HTML</a> is made up of HTML elements that are tbe building blocks of any document. </p>



    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is what is used to style HTML pages; it displays how HTML pages should be displayed. By using CSS, the contents of the pages and the styling can be separated into different building blocks. CSS is another <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2318">standard</a> that is maintained by the W3C. </p>
