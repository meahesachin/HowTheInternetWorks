      <p>HyperText Tranfer Protocol (HTTP) and HHTP Secure (HTTPS) are the protocols that make the internet work. We've so far seen the means to get on the Intenet, how the traffic is travels on the wires. This page talks about the protocols that brings things together for the user. It makes the "Thing" work!</p>

      <p>Before we dive into details, let's tal abtou what a protocol is. It is a set of rules that are used for a specific purpose. In the case of HTTP, it is a communication protocol that is used by the Internet to communicate between resources.</p>

      <p>When a user or an application wants to "use" the Internet, they go to an Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which points to a server (resource) that hosts the application they want to use. The language they communicate in is HTTP or HTTPS. HTTPS is a secure form of HTTP that (using TLS) encrypts traffic as it moves over the wires.</p>

    <p></p>

      <p>The language consists of hypertet that links directly to other text and hyperlinks that connects one document to another using links. It also includes status codes that indicate to the requester what is happening with their request. The codes include 200 which indicates all is well, 404 which indicates page was not found and many others. The complete specification for HTTP can be found <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230"> here</a>.The complete HTTPS specification is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818"> here</a>.</p>

      <p>HTTPS was developed to address attacks such as man in the middle attacks. Using HTTPS, the two parties communicating can be sure that the information has not been intercepted and the communication is happening between parties who are who they say they are.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>The DNS server in the local network is called Start of Authority(SOA) for that domain. Over time, the results from looking up hosts at the SOA will propagate to other DNS servers. How long these results stay on the remote servers depends on the Time To Live (TTL) parameter which each DNS server can set for it's results propagating across the Internet.</p>
